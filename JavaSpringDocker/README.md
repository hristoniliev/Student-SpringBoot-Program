I am building an API with Spring Boot in which any client may submit a request. These requests can be GET, POST, DELETE, PUT. Then I am taking that request 
and within the API layer or control layer(where we receive the requests) send them to the service layer. In my case the client was provided from Postman and 
could do the following: POST people with auto-generated ID(UUID) and a Name, GET all people or the one with provided ID, DELETE a person by only providing ID 
and the same with PUT - Update person's name by ID.
